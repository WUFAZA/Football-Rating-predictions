# Football Player Rating Prediction

This project predicts the ratings of football players for the upcoming year using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a supervised machine learning model ideal for both classification and regression challenges. It works by identifying the hyperplane that best separates data points based on their characteristics.

## How the Code Works

1. **Data Collection:**
   The dataset includes historical performance data of football players and their past ratings. {Provide details about the dataset source and features used.}

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and normalize the dataset.
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Standardize features for consistent scaling.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train an SVM model on historical performance data to learn patterns.
   - Optimize the SVM hyperplane for accurate predictions.

4. **Prediction:**
   - Use the trained model to predict player ratings for the next year.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Example Code Snippet

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('football_player_data.csv')  # Replace with your dataset file
X = data.drop('Player_Rating', axis=1)         # Replace 'Player_Rating' with the target column
y = data['Player_Rating']

# Preprocess data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train SVM model
svm_model = SVR(kernel='linear')
svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)}")

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the following link:  
[Football Player Dataset 2022 - CLEAN FIFA 23 Official Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/falaprodavi/Football-Player-Dataset2022/refs/heads/main/datasets/CLEAN_FIFA23_official_data.csv).

It contains detailed information about football players, with the following features:  

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each player  
- **Name**: Player's full name  
- **Age**: Player's age  
- **Photo**: URL to the player's image  
- **Nationality**: Player's country of origin  
- **Flag**: URL to the flag of the player's nationality  
- **Overall**: Player's overall rating  
- **Potential**: Player's potential rating  
- **Club**: Current club of the player  
- **Club Logo**: URL to the club's logo  
- **Value (£)**: Player's market value in GBP  
- **Wage (£)**: Player's weekly wage in GBP  
- **Special**: A unique scoring metric  
- **Preferred Foot**: Player's dominant foot  
- **International Reputation**: Player's international recognition level (1–5)  
- **Weak Foot**: Player's weak foot rating (1–5)  
- **Skill Moves**: Skill moves rating (1–5)  
- **Work Rate**: Player's work rate (offense/defense)  
- **Body Type**: Description of the player's physique  
- **Real Face**: Indicator of whether the player’s face is realistically rendered in FIFA  
- **Position**: Player's primary playing position  
- **Joined**: Date the player joined the current club  
- **Loaned From**: Club the player is loaned from, if applicable  
- **Contract Valid Until**: Contract expiration date  
- **Height (cm)**: Player's height in centimeters  
- **Weight (lbs)**: Player's weight in pounds  
- **Release Clause (£)**: Player’s release clause value in GBP  
- **Kit Number**: Player's shirt number  
- **Best Overall Rating**: Highest overall rating the player achieved  
- **Year_Joined**: Year the player joined their current club  

These features allow for detailed analysis and prediction of player ratings for the upcoming year.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

Standardizing the features using StandardScaler

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split

## Model Training

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used for training the model. The following steps are performed:

Importing the SVR (Support Vector Regressor) from scikit-learn

Training the model on the training data

Making predictions on the test data

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as the mean_squared_error to measure the variance between predicted and actual ratings. {Add additional metrics if applicable.}

## Usage

To run the notebook, open Player_Rating_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially.
